## Changi Airport

I was transit in Singapore and I had 20 hours to explore the city. The first thing that I noticed when I landed to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/1mGzq92edhqu5Xo4A" target="_blank">Changi Airport</a> was the cleanliness. It was really clean. I felt like I am in a 5 star hotel. The airport is really big. There are a lot of shops, restaurants and cafes.

But be careful, the prices are really high. As a backpacker, I just got free hot water from the cafes and I eat my noodles (from Indonesia). Also I slept in the airport when I arrived. It was really comfortable. There are a lot of chairs and sofas. I think it is the best airport in the world.

## Jewel Changi Airport

After I slept for 6 hours, I woke up and I went to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ECUx5gSXGQQkSUL69" target="_blank">Jewel Changi Airport</a>. It is a shopping mall. It is really big. There are a lot of shops, restaurants and cafes. Also there is a big waterfall. It is really nice. I took a lot of photos. Also there is a big garden.

## Gardens by the Bay

After I visited the Jewel Changi Airport, I went to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zM36eaBB92AyQa6R8" target="_blank">Gardens by the Bay</a> with the MRT. MRT is the subway in Singapore. The subway lines are so smartly designed. You can go everywhere with the MRT. Also the stations are really clean.

## Walking Around

Caution! "Please give way to otters" signs are everywhere. I didn't believe it at first. But then I saw a family of otters crossing the road. How cute!

Also the whole city just designed perfectly. You can walk, drive, no traffic, no pollution. There is a lot of funny signs everywhere. One of them is "Runners turn left" sign. I saw a lot of runners on the morning (something like 6-7 am).

## Marina Bay Sands

I went to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/B6Fka8RXa1ubhiP29" target="_blank">Marina Bay Sands</a> after the Gardens by the Bay. It is a hotel and a shopping mall. The architecture is really nice. There is a big pool on the top of the building. It's most popular symbol of Singapore. Also there is a big shopping mall. There are a lot of shops. Also there is a big casino. I didn't go there. I don't like gambling. So haram :)

## Sultan Mosque

I went to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WRJqArguq11ijHWs5" target="_blank">Sultan Mosque</a> after the Marina Bay Sands. It is a historical mosque. The architecture is really nice. There are a lot of tourists. Because of my european apperance, the mosque staff didn't let me in at first and then after I explained that I am a muslim, they let me in. Because, the for tourists there is time period to visit inside of the mosque. It was really nice.

Also I tried some North-Indian restaurant near to the mosque. Here's what I try to eat "Called Biryani", It was like 12 SD (Singaporean Dolar). That was my first and the only expense in Singapore.

## Conclusion

My short visit to Singapore was really nice. The only thing is the prices are really high for low budget travelers. But the city is really clean and safe. I really enjoyed my time in Singapore. I will definitely come back again.
